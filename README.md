This tool is a calculator to calculate compound interest using four inputs. For principal amount, number of times compounded annually, and total number of years compounded, type in a number value or click the stepper to choose your number. For interest rate, drag the slider to pick the percentage for your interest rate and the value will be displayed below and updated as you drag. The total amount and the compound interest you earned will automatically update as you enter all your values.
